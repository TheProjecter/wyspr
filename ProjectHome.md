Wyspr (pronouncer whisper) is a decentralised chat protocol (think a bit like the love-child of IRC and bittorrent) currently under development towards version one.

The basic principal is based on the concept of 'client' and 'host' 'nodes', combining to create a general network. Both types of nodes should be supported by any piece of software for the protocol.

The network is supported by a 'backbone' of host nodes, which are all connected together, and each provide a 'gateway' to the network for a number of client nodes' The hosts pass messages on from any of their clients that send them to all the other hosts in the network, and messages they receive from other hosts to all the clients they support.
